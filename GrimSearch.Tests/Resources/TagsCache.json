Father always told us not to, that we would be swept away by the harpies that fill the sky in the twilight hours. But what if he was not just trying to protect us? Perhaps there were ulterior motives to keeping us away from the old places of the world? What if, should we venture inside, we would learn more about his past than he wished for us to know?{^n}{^n}I have done what you could not, Daila.

The stones screamed with unfettered rage, rage towards...me. Do the dead despise the living so? Do they yearn after what was stolen from them? To exist in such a state of endless limbo would drive any soul mad, but I do not believe that madness is what inspired this response. There was something familiar within these stones.{^n}{^n}I have to learn more. So I intend to visit the one place I know our father had been: our childhood home.

The resulting flames consumed the book and marked my face with embers that refuse to extinguish. It is agonizing, but I will endure. Despite our father's efforts, I was able to rescue some pages from the inferno. He told us that our mother died in childbirth, that much is true, but what you do not know is that we were not the first.

It has taken him a thousand-thousand souls trapped within a single moment of agony to accomplish this impossible deed. What dark day in history served in the pursuit of immortality, I cannot say. But here, in the Necropolis, our father prepared a different ritual. This one was meant to harvest what remained of the tormented dead within the grave site, to replenish his own shattered being, but for whatever reason he never finished it. The sigil was abandoned. All that remained was to light the pyre and offer a living sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Without hesitation, I finished what he could not. Though I am not truly immortal as he is, the power within these souls will be enough for me to track him down and repay him for all the suffering he has instilled upon us.

Thus, I cast the dice and raced toward the heart of Erulan, trying to conceal myself as best I could.{^n}{^n}Upon my arrival, I proceeded cautiously, booking a room at a squalid inn near the west gates in an effort to keep my arrival secret.

Taken unawares, I was disarmed before I even knew what was happening. Had he sought my death, I would not have even witnessed the killing stroke fall. However, he seemed more interested in answers instead and, in turn, provided me with an account of his own events that confirmed my worst fears.{^n}{^n}The First Blade revealed that, only days prior, he had been forced to turn his knives on the Emperor himself, by his own command. Despite the myriad safeguards protecting the Emperor, both mundane and arcane, he had become host to an Aetherial. Through strength of mind, he had usurped his possessor long enough to summon the First Blade, command his own execution and charge the assassin with ensuring that his son, the young prince, survive to reclaim the throne.{^n}{^n}His last commands issued, the Emperor's consciousness slipped once again under the control of the Aetherial and a desperate battle ensued. The First Blade reported that he believed the Emperor and the Aetherial within him slain but, given his inexperience with the entities, could not say anything for certain. He relayed that he had secretly taken the prince and put him into hiding but declined to elaborate. The First Blade said he intended to retire his imperial title and had chosen the name Ulgrim, which made me curious as to whether it was an intentional reference to the mythic character.{^n}{^n}A final troubling detail was that no proclamation of the Emperor's passing had been issued. Not only did this demonstrate the Aetherials had sufficient control of the palace to conceal the death but, given that they couldn't hope to hide the Emperor's absence for long, it suggested the next phase of their operation was imminent.{^n}{^n}I strategized with Ulgrim long into the night, formulating a plan to counter the Aetherials, but ultimately we agreed that we could not defeat their conspiracy in time. The only course left was gather whatever people and resources we could, go to ground and weather the coming storm; then find a way to counter the invaders.{^n}{^n}We agreed that the Black Legion would be our best hope in securing allies. As a conscripted army of criminals, debtors and political dissidents bound to service, it seemed unlikely that the Aetherials would have any reason to infiltrate them when they could control them indirectly through the military high command.

Ever the skeptic, I figured it for a sham; political theatre at best, but the ritual seems to have been a tragic success.{^n}{^n}This ritual was the invention of a necromancer named Uroboruuk. A man imprisoned in the Steps of Torment, who it is said did not age and could not be killed by any means. The leaders of the three greatest houses, including my own patron, Laudos Vagra, made an ill-conceived journey to the tower in hopes of compelling this Uroboruuk to give up his secrets. Here, immortality worked against Uroboruuk as he was subjected to the most brutal and imaginative forms of torture that could be devised for a man who could not die. Finally, Uroboruuk agreed to instruct them in the ritual and the Oligarchs, blinded by their lust for immortality, were all too eager to believe his will broken and accepted the ritual as genuine.{^n}{^n}It has become clear that the people of Arkovia have indeed gained a form of immortality but it is a cruel and twisted fulfillment of that promise. Our bodies still suffer the ravages of time, eventually dying and decaying, whilst our spirits remain trapped within, eternally bound to this land.{^n}{^n}I have witnessed this myself as the sick and elderly, near death at the time of the ritual, remain with us yet.

They become ever more narrowly focused on whatever concerned them most in life.

Abominations they say, deformed and bearing dark grisly feathers. It is said that many forlorn new fathers have been seen trekking into the broken hills, bundle in arm, to leave their unnatural offspring to the elements.{^n}{^n}The din of fighting and wailing continues on below.

Its short lifespan and rapidly shedding skin made for a malleable test subject. The initial results seemed promising at first. Using high concentrations of Aether energy, we were able to instill various mutations within the specimens, creating new limbs or inducing gigantism. Unfortunately, none of the samples survived beyond a couple weeks, their higher brain functions being seemingly incapable of handling the introduction of additional bodily elements.{^n}{^n}For our second batch of experiments, we molded the adders with a few grobles captured by local trappers. The results were...curious to say the least. While this was not the breakthrough I was looking for, we seem to be heading in the right direction. The dull mind of a groble was capable of adapting to its new body, but its primitive and disgustingly malformed physique would see me become the laughing stock of my colleagues.

There is no other way to put it. King Rhowan, the third of his line, had been struck by madness. Upon returning from a successful campaign against the barbarian tribes of Agarond's Peak, the King raved about a chance meeting with a weary traveler whom he called Mogdrogen. Rhowan, in his generosity, offered the old man the use of his horse. The man, and here is where the King's tale loses all sense, declined the proposal and, speaking in a low voice that only his Majesty could hear, instead offered Rhowan a warning.{^n}{^n}The old man spurted prophetic lies about the impending collapse of our great nation and the fall of the beacon of the west, Arkovia herself. He implored the King to leave his title, his wealth, his very identity behind. There were some amongst the court who urged Rhowan to see his madness through, greedy heads of Arkovian Houses who saw this tragedy as an opportunity to seize power. The Queen, the shining jewel of Arkovia, wept before her King and begged him to reconsider; but Rhowan was resolute. With a single decree, he shattered the royal line and abandoned his ordained post as King of Arkovia. Word of the King's madness spread quickly among the populace. To my great surprise, some of his subjects followed Rhowan's lead, abandoning their livelihoods to follow their despondent ruler into a life of poverty and lost identity.{^n}{^n}It has been three fortnights since that fateful day. The queen lies dead in her chambers. They say she had died of sorrow, from the loss of her King, but I suspect more clandestine causes. The court has fallen into chaos as the great Houses bicker amongst themselves for the empty throne. With no end in sight to the squabbles and no clear line to the throne, my patron, Laudos Vagra, has called for the formation of an Oligarchy, ruled by the heads of Arkovia's elite.{^n}{^n}No good can come of this.

Same things happen with wealthy men and scheming nobility the world over.{^n}{^n}More recently, he bade me to recover an ancestral artifact from his father's tomb. The family Signet Ring. A thing that should not have been buried he says. But the argument between father and son led to rash decisions. I care not for the reason, his coin was always good, but I say nothing and let him speak. He went on to say \"The tomb is lavished in my family's vast wealth of the ages. Touch nothing.

In my dreams, this power is familiar to me, almost welcoming, but as soon as I am free of the dream, the meaning is lost upon my waking mind.{^n}{^n}I make haste through the concealing fog towards the Harbormaster's offices. There I find myself in a poorly lit room with two figures obscured by shadows, both men. One is large and loud. He smells of rotting fish and stale beer. The other is also large, but more in physical stature than the girth of his belt. He clinks and scrapes with the sound of metal as he moves. A soldier or town guard perhaps.{^n}{^n}They talk but I cannot make out what they say. The sense of dread and malice that pours from these men is a palpable wave of fire. In my heart I know that the decisions made around that table will mark the end of the world for mankind.{^n}{^n}But last night's dream was different; it kept going. I find myself with a bird's eye view of the city, watching as arcane fire spreads across the horizon. It grows as far as the eye can see and burns all it touches to ash and oblivion. Then, as if floating at the end of a rope, in one hard pull I find myself back in the dark room. The pungent odor of unwashed men and rotting ocean fills my nose. I stare into a cracked mirror hanging on the wall, but I do not see myself staring back. It is the face of the High Advisor, his expression first marked by surprise and then anger. For a brief moment I catch the same fires that consumed the world stirring within his eyes.{^n}{^n}In that instant the dream shattered and I awoke out of breath and tangled in sweat-soaked sheets. But I knew that it was more than just a nightmare spurred by an overactive imagination. He saw me through the glass, just as I saw him. I bore witness to something I was never meant to see. And now my identity is compromised. I must leave this place. Get as far away as I can.{^n}{^n}I will head southeast, across the dark waters. Eerily familiar voices have been calling to me from that area for some time. I don't know why, but in my heart I am certain that safe haven awaits me in the bog. A boat leaves for Burrwitch in the morning. I intend to be on it.{^n}{^n}-Callia",

Local sailors spread rumors of corruption and tax hikes while the city guard overlooked the crimes committed by my subordinates to stir up gossip. I became a bit uneasy when we started using the rumors about witches to smuggle women to Malmouth, but Aldritch reassured me that they would be well taken care of, and we were paid handsomely for each one, so I chose not to question it further.{^n}{^n}One evening, when we gathered to discuss future plans, Aldritch suddenly began acting very strange. He kept looking over his shoulder as if somebody were watching, and his expression became downright ghastly when he stared at the mirror hanging on my wall. He cut the meeting short and demanded that all future discussion be carried out via courier. Very strange, but I did not think much of it at the time. Figured the old man was getting paranoid as his plans came to fruition.{^n}{^n}That left me to deal with Captain Brastock directly. I have never met a more cruel and opportunistic man in my life, and I know every sailor that comes through these parts. I can't imagine it took much to convince him to join the High Advisor's schemes. He informed me that the reports of witches were coming in too slowly, so his men began planting weapons in people's homes to warrant arrests. Each ship sailing to Malmouth is now overflowing with would-be criminals. What Aldritch needs all these people for is beyond me.{^n}{^n}It was not until the day Aldritch asked me to transport several large boxes to him in high town though that I started to suspect that something was amiss. Seemed innocent enough at the time, until one of the crane ropes snapped and a crate dropped several feet onto the cobblestones. The wood splintered in several places and a sickening smell flared up our nostrils and made our skin crawl. The crate shook, as if something was alive in there. I could make out a faint green light through the cracks in the side. I had my men carry that thing out of my docks as soon as able.{^n}{^n}But it was not 'til the day of Captain Brastock's very bloody public execution that I began to suspect that we are all merely pawns in Aldritch's game and that in the end the only winner of this uprising would be none other than the High Advisor himself.

I don't want to diminish the immensity of such a triumph, especially given the small force and limited resources we're working with but I fear it has come at great cost. While our attention was focused on denying the Loghorrean entrance to this world, the Aetherials were certainly not idle.{^n}{^n}Many in Devil's Crossing have paid the ultimate price but such is the way of war and it may sound callous to say but we traded well. Losing only a handful while preventing a monstrosity from escaping the void that could have heralded the end of the world as we know it is a win for humanity.{^n}{^n}What disturbs me though is the loss of Ulgrim to the void. Bourbon apparently does not share my concern and I think he sees it as ill-afforded sentiment on my part. Bourbon sees Ulgrim as merely a man but I am certain there is more to him. I believe he is an ascendant, a man who has become a demi-god.{^n}{^n}Ulgrim expertly plays the part of a jovial and unassuming character but his eyes say much more. He makes off-handed references to historical events with details and a familiarity of someone recalling a personal memory. For all his outward jocularity, there is gravity to him and it is clear he has witnessed much; I suspect more than one could experience in a single lifetime.{^n}{^n}Yet, for all that, and despite his obvious efforts to downplay it, Ulgrim possesses remarkable strength and energy for the middle-aged man he appears to be. He often carries himself in a relaxed, casual manner, moving languidly; but at rare moments, I have seen him react and move with impossible speed.{^n}{^n}I feel that he could do much more than he has, in fighting the enemies of man but I am not sure why he is holding back. Perhaps we will never know now. Maybe Bourbon is right, perhaps Ulgrim is lost to the void. Somehow though, I feel we will see him again and, if we do, it would go a long way toward confirming my suspicions.{^n}{^n}Then again, strange times are these, where a nameless wretch, cut down from the noose, has risen to become possibly the greatest hero of our time.{^n}{^n}If the Taken continues on this path and survives this war, I wonder if perhaps they too are on the path of ascendancy.",

I find it impossible now to dismiss the idea that he is indeed the Ulgrim of legend and an immortal ascendant.{^n}{^n}As much as I am grateful to have such a powerful ally in this war, I cannot help but feel a little on edge when he is present. Between Ulgrim and the recent rumors of Mogdrogen, I am concerned that other divinities may also begin involving themselves in worldly affairs; as it is said they did more commonly in ancient times.{^n}{^n}This leads me back to the lingering mystery of Kymon. It is apparent that he and his followers are drawling power from some godlike force, but who or what? I am very doubtful of Kymon's claim that it is Empyrion that guides him, as he initially suggested. The power I sensed in Kymon's emissary to Homestead had a feeling of...malevolence to it.{^n}{^n}Kymon was once a brethren inquisitor, but he went rogue in the years before the Grim Dawn. He is clearly not Aetherial, but I fear he's entered into some manner of dark pact with an unknown power. Certainly if Empyrion, the high-god of legend, returned to Cairn, a power such as that would be felt on a larger scale than merely one raving fanatic leading a group of vagabonds.{^n}{^n}None the less, whatever entity is behind Kymon's Chosen, clearly it does possess significant power and I am troubled, not knowing its identity or motivations.",

My mind fills with questions for which there cannot be answers; or, if there are, could we truly be meant to know them?{^n}{^n}The gods work in mysterious ways. Our patron gives and takes, but I believe he is generous to those who follow without question. I now understand the necessities of our existence, that our choices have consequences and that we must bow our heads in reverence for all that we had been given.{^n}{^n}We can never forget that without Him, we would be as nothing. Our homes would be consumed by the waters of the bog and our people devoured by the wendigos that had succumbed to madness. From them, we must take example; for disobedience breeds death, and we must remain resolute in our commitment.",

Though I've found cuts from our recent quarries to be a bit tough and lean, they are not entirely unpleasant; much like a freshly slaughtered deer. And while I initially found the taste nauseating, I've become increasingly fond of its delicate layers and nuances.{^n}{^n}As one of the favored among Scorv's company, I've generally had my pick of the best cuts, so I always enthusiastically go for a butchered portion of leg or upper arm. I ask to leave the bone in, as it really seals in the flavor and keeps the meat juicy after cooking. Nevertheless, my recent experimentations reveal that a shorter cooking time is by far the most satisfying.{^n}{^n}With the addition of some finely chopped black onions and a gentle sprinkling of Wightmire herbs seared alongside the meat, the still bloody cuts make for an exquisite experience that is the envy of everyone in Barrowholm. The critical trick is to sear it on the outside while leaving the inside still dripping with juices.{^n}{^n}Scorv himself said that my inspirations could cure even a ravaging hunger, but I know he just says this to keep up our spirits.

The muscle was tough and the flavor made it difficult to swallow, especially when it was raw. But Scorv insisted that to truly embrace the gifts of the Great One, we must learn to enjoy it in its natural state, rather than resorting to seasonings or flame.{^n}{^n}I was resistant, as were the others, but in time I came around to embrace the feeling of fresh blood seeping between my teeth, the iron taste of gore upon my tongue. Hunger helped that a bit, I'm sure, but now I feel chills at the thought of a fresh victim. I believe this is what Scorv meant when he said we would become closer to our master.{^n}{^n}The thrill, the energy, the change...I can feel the change. It grows inside of me. It began with darkening of the eyes, like a deep crimson. Others further along in their journey have expressed concerns about bone pain throughout the body. Scorv reassures us that this was normal and will pass.{^n}{^n}Whatever changes it brings, I now anticipate them with a nervous joy. I wish only to be closer to Ravager.{^n}{^n}-Olidia",

In the darkness of night, the god sought out Ravager's lair and, with the aid of his slaves, he banished the Great One from this realm.{^n}{^n}Bodiless and forgotten, Ravager threw himself against his spiritual prison. He sought to return to this realm and right the wrongs done to him; and through our sacrifices the day of his judgment has nearly come. We shall become the harbingers of his will, the benefactors of his mercy.

He said passage would be difficult but we could make it if we stuck together. He couldn't have been more wrong.{^n}{^n}We weren't one day out of town when things started going poorly. First Beatrix came down with a fever. Her skin went pale and her eyes glazed over.

The following day, the same thing happened to Heinrich.{^n}{^n}With both of them sick, we were forced to travel slowly. Frasier and I towed them behind us in a makeshift sled. Too far from Burrwitch to turn back, but Frasier said he knew of an inn that was less than a day's travel ahead, so we continued onward. When we reached the inn it was abandoned and the air hung heavy with the scent of death. But we were desperate and in need of shelter so we stayed there nonetheless.{^n}{^n}That night was when the noises started. Frasier said he didn't hear none of it. But I could make it out loud and clear. It sounded like an animal growling and moving about just outside the inn. As the night wore on, the noises became louder and louder and I began to question my sanity. Frasier insisted that it was nothing but I could swear they were right outside. When dawn came, I didn't want to move but Frasier forced me out of the inn. He said we had to continue or we wouldn't make it to safety. So we began pulling the sled north along the overgrown road.{^n}{^n}As we moved I could hear it following us, its footsteps mirroring our own. Beatrix and Heinrich were getting sicker by the minute and we soon grew tired of hauling the sled. My hands were blistered and my feet bloodied from the rough path. Frasier said we had to leave them, the sled was just too heavy for us to pull, but that didn't sit right with me. We argued back and forth about their fate, each becoming more and more angered as we continued. That was when Frasier grabbed his camp hatchet and threatened to kill them right then and there. He said if I wouldn't let them go, he'd just do it for me. I didn't mean for what happened next, but I was scared and the growling sounds bore down on me like a fire in my mind. I shoved him and he stumbled over a root, falling face first into his hatchet which lodged itself in the right side of his chest. He looked up at me in horror as blood filled his lungs and mouth.{^n}{^n}That's when I saw it, standing behind Frasier at the edge of the woods. A massive hideous figure, like a man with the head of a dead animal. I froze for a moment and then bolted down the road. As I ran I could hear Frasier's gurgling screams begging me not to leave him.{^n}{^n}I can still hear them, all three of them wailing in the darkness like rabbits being eaten by a fox. It's been hours, why won't they die? Is that thing still out there? Is it taunting me? I can't go on, I can't take it anymore...",

There's been common folk from further south than Devil's Crossing and groups of men and women moving about with strange new markings on their armor and clothes. We even had a fella a couple a weeks back, claimed he came all the way south from the capital. Said he was a chef looking for work. I didn't have room for him, so I suggested he try in Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}It's not just the people that are strange. There's been an uneasy feeling in the forest as I'm sure you've noticed.

It was a big swamp buck, 10-points if I remember correctly. A kill like that usually brings in the vultures but the dressings have been sitting out in the wood festering since and no sight of those hideous things. If it sits out much longer it'll draw out Carraxus for sure. I swear that crusty old bastard has doubled in size and gotten twice as ugly since I last saw him. He's been up around the inn twice in the last year, stealing things. Supposedly he even took a milk cow from Gretchen's stable. I shouldn't like to think what happened to that poor thing. Fire used to scare him off but he seems to have become bolder as he's grown. Whoever finds that creature's lair is in for a right heap of useless junk and more crab than a man could eat in a lifetime.

I cannot imagine a less dignified, more depraved group of individuals has ever served as the leadership of our fine city. What right does he have to return after such long absence, pursuing his own goals in the capital, and begin imposing policy on the high families.{^n}{^n}It has been the birthright of my family to serve on the city council for four generations. I am not about to stand idly by and allow the Marcell family to manipulate the political structure of our city and I do hope you feel the same.{^n}{^n}I will be filing an official complaint directly to the High Council and the Lord Regent's office of Erulan and I ask that you and your house support me in refutation of Theodin Marcell's illegitimate claim to power. I have also heard incredibly disturbing rumors about his \"education\" at a medical institution there in the capital. These rumors claim he was forced to leave after an egregious misuse of power. If this is true it may add legitimacy to our claim.{^n}{^n}In the meantime I am taking steps to gather opposition against the blatant political ambitions of the Marcell house and plan to contact each of the high houses of Crown Hill individually, seeking their support. Yours is the first I have reached out to as our families have proven to be staunch allies in the political sea of our fine city.{^n}{^n}I am well prepared to take any and all action against Marcell and the families of those buffoons he's appointed to the council and I hope you will stand by me when that day comes.{^n}{^n}With Regards,{^n}{^n}-Fredric Greystone",

Just this morning, I received a missive from house Greystone wherein Fredric Greystone threatened to report you to the High Council of Erulan and asked for my support in his \"refutation\" of your \"illegitimate claim to power\". For now, I have no choice but to go along with his little coup so as to defend the reputation of House Marion.{^n}{^n}Greystone also had a number of interesting accusations about your time in the capital.

Reports from High Advisor Van Aldritch indicate that the collection of specimens is now running without interference and they will be packaged and prepared for your personal needs posthaste. It seems our investment in that vessel was well placed, as you believed it would.{^n}{^n}Our remaining challenge is moving the specimens through the harbor. I have diverted the deliveries to the Blackiron docks, where closer scrutiny of cargo is less probable due to the frequent military shipments, and the overbearing schedule we've imposed upon the dock workers is keeping them too busy to ask questions.{^n}{^n}Despite that, we currently have surprisingly little oversight there. However, Vernath of the Port Authority has proven to be a pleasantly simple target. He is a petty and insecure man, traits that make for easy pickings. Through him, we have ordered the harbormasters to issue weekly reports highlighting unusual activity or unexpected arrivals. This allows us to monitor harbor activity more closely and silence any unfortunate leaks of our plans before we are ready to execute the Glorious Dawn. Swiftly dealing with accidents will sow fear and distrust among the dock workers, ensuring that further incidents are avoided.{^n}{^n}Additionally, work on the great houses of Crown Hill has been proceeding rapidly. As has been quite common among these humans, the wealthy people of this city are conceited, disloyal and power hungry. They fight, even amongst their own families, with but the slightest provocation. The council shall continue to encourage such infighting until such a time as we have gained sufficient influence among the city's elite and selected the most susceptible vessels.{^n}{^n}Respectfully,{^n}{^n}Councilman In Residence{^n}{^n}Alberran Rein",

At the recommendation of Overlord Van Aldritch, I decree a change to a recent consensus.{^n}{^n}It is then a consensus that the Shaper of Flesh be recalled to Malmouth immediately and allowed to finish his latest work without further interruptions.

The journey was not without merit however, as I did observe some peculiar phenomena along the way; creatures that, while seemingly natural, did not exhibit the standard range of phenotypes one would expect from this region, almost as if they've been plucked out from another place and relocated here within an instant.{^n}{^n}Most fascinating of all has been the talk of the camp for days now, a creature the locals have named Kra'vall, the Ancient of the Waters. Thus far, we've caught but a glimpse of one of its massive tentacles. I can only guess as to the full size of the beast, but it is enormous and quite unlike anything else found within the waters of Ugdenbog.{^n}{^n}Our journey had brought us to what I suspect is its underwater lair and my inquisitor companion immediately began complaining of headaches much like those she's experienced when near heavy concentrations of Eldritch magic. This combined with its unusual appearance leads me to conclude that this creature, and others like it, are Eldritch in nature. But are these manifestations the fickle playthings of the Witch Gods, or perhaps something else entirely?{^n}{^n}-Gallad Nico, Imperial Archivist"
