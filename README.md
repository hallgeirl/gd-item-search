# Grim Dawn Item Search

Someone that has played Grim Dawn for a while may start losing track of all his or her items across the various characters, mules and stashes. This application aims to resolve this by allowing you to search for items, based on item names, certain stats, as well as filtering based on quality, level requirements and item types. Additionally, you can easily find out what items on a particular character is also found on others.
